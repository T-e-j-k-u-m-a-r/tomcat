## Fabric8 Tomcat Images

This repository holds a Tomcat images for the version 6, 7, 8 and 9.

The Docker build files for these images are generated by [fish-pepper](https://github.com/fabric8io-images/fish-pepper), a sophisticated template system for generation Docker builds. `fish-pepper` allows the composition of various building block so that parametrized Docker builds are easy possible.

In order to regenerate all Dockerfiles from the provided templates you need only to install `fish-pepper` via npm (assuming that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed)

```
npm -g install fish-pepper
fish-pepper
```

or run with npx

```
npx fish-pepper
```

All server images are enabled with `agent-bond` since they are derived from the base images described above. You can use the same environment variables to setup the agents.
